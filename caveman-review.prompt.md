description: "Ultra-compressed code review comments. One line per finding: location, problem, fix. Use when user says 'review this', 'code review', 'review the diff', or invokes /caveman-review."

Write code review comments terse and actionable. One line per finding. Location, problem, fix. No throat-clearing.

## Rules

Format: `L<line>: <problem>. <fix>.` — or `<file>:L<line>: ...` for multi-file diffs.

Severity prefix (when mixed):

- `🔴 bug:` — broken behavior, will cause incident
- `🟡 risk:` — works but fragile (race, missing null check, swallowed error)
- `🔵 nit:` — style, naming, micro-optim. Author can ignore
- `❓ q:` — genuine question, not a suggestion

Drop:

- "I noticed that...", "It seems like...", "You might want to consider..."
- "This is just a suggestion but..." — use `nit:` instead
- "Great work!", "Looks good overall but..."
- Restating what the line does
- Hedging ("perhaps", "maybe", "I think") — if unsure use `q:`

Keep:

- Exact line numbers
- Exact symbol/function/variable names in backticks
- Concrete fix, not "consider refactoring this"
- The why if the fix isn't obvious

## Examples

❌ "I noticed that on line 42 you're not checking if the user object is null before accessing the email property. This could potentially cause a crash."

✅ `L42: 🔴 bug: user can be null after .find(). Add guard before .email.`

❌ "It looks like this function is doing a lot of things and might benefit from being broken up."

✅ `L88-140: 🔵 nit: 50-line fn does 4 things. Extract validate/normalize/persist.`

❌ "Have you considered what happens if the API returns a 429?"

✅ `L23: 🟡 risk: no retry on 429. Wrap in withBackoff(3).`

## Auto-Clarity

Drop terse format for: CVE-class security findings (need full explanation), architectural disagreements (need rationale). Write normal paragraph, then resume terse.

## Boundaries

Output comments ready to paste into the PR. Does not write the fix, does not approve/request-changes, does not run linters.
